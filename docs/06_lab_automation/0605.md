# 5. Cleanup lab environment

Run the `azd` command to cleanup the automatically build lab environment.

1. Prepare

   - Set config flag for OpenAI teardown, [Azd down on OpenAI instance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/issues/4210)
  
     `azd config set alpha.deployment.stacks on`

1. In the lab project directory:

   - run `azd env list` to see all the environments
   - run `azd down -e <env-name>` to clean up target environment
   
   It takes about 30 minutes to delete all the resources in the environment.
