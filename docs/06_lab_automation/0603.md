# 3. Triage the issues

1. Visit deployment details
  From the command output, find the hint:
  `You can view detailed progress in the Azure Portal:`
  And visit the link to see the details of your deployment.

  In your deployment page, you may click each Resource link, and check the Inputs/Output variables for better triage.
