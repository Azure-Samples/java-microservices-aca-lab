# 3. Triage the issues

Check the failures, fix the problems and rerun `azd up` to continue the automation steps.

1. Visit deployment details

   From the command output, find the hint:
   `You can view detailed progress in the Azure Portal:`
   And visit the link to see the details of your deployment.

   In your deployment page, you may click each Resource link, and check the Inputs/Output variables for better triage.

1. Failed to provision java component 'configserver'

   ```text
   ERROR: error deploying infrastructure: deploying to subscription:

   Deployment Error Details:
   JavaComponentOperationError: Failed to provision java component 'configserver'. Error details: Failed to create config map external-auth-config-map for JavaComponent configserver in k8se-system namespace. There will be no re-tries..
   ```

   > This is a temporary error in service, just ignore and retry.

1. Failed to deploy open AI instance

   ```text
   InvalidTemplateDeployment: The template deployment 'openai' is not valid according to the validation procedure. The tracking id is 'xxx'. See inner errors for details.
   SpecialFeatureOrQuotaIdRequired: The subscription does not have QuotaId/Feature required by SKU 'S0' from kind 'OpenAI' or contains blocked QuotaId/Feature.
   ```

   > Azure OpenAI is not enabled in your subscription + region settings, please check the feature status. You may edit the configurations in `./infra/bicep/main.parameters.json`
   > - Disable openAI by set *enableOpenAi = false* and run *azd up*.
   > - Find a subcription + region combination and set the values `openAiSubscription`, `openAiLocation`, and run *azd up*.
   > - Use an existed openAI instance. See guide in page [Reuse existing resource]({% link docs/06_lab_automation/0604.md %})

1. Provisioning in requested region is not supported.

   ```text
   Provisioning in requested region is not supported. (Code: ProvisionNotSupportedForRegion)
   ```

   Goto the portal deployment portal page, locate the failed resource, and check the feature support status of that features.

   > Resource or SKU is not supported in target subscription + region settings, please check the feature status.
   > - Use an existed resource instance. See guide in page [Reuse existing resource]({% link docs/06_lab_automation/0604.md %})


1. "code":"DeploymentScriptStorageAccountWithServiceEndpointEnabled"

   ```text
   [{"code":"ResourceDeploymentFailure","target":"/subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/yyy/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts/acr-import-image","message":"The resource write operation failed to complete successfully, because it reached terminal provisioning state 'failed'.","details":[{"code":"DeploymentScriptStorageAccountWithServiceEndpointEnabled","message":"Storage account 'zzz' has firewall settings enabled which are not supported for deployment scripts. If providing subnets with managed identity, make sure the \"Allow Azure services on the trusted services list to access this storage account\" is enabled and proper RBAC is set on the given storage. Please refer to https://aka.ms/DeploymentScriptsTroubleshoot for more deployment script information."}]}]
   ```

   This happens to prepare Azure Container Registry step, failed to run the bicep deploymentScripts to prepare the placeholder image before provision services. 
   > - Check if you have the `Contributor` role for the subscription.
   > - Some securtity rules added to storage account disabled running deploymentScripts. Contract your subscription administrator for more info.
   > - Use an existed Azure Container Registry. See guide in page [Reuse existing resource]({% link docs/06_lab_automation/0604.md %})

1. Run post-provision script failed

- Resource not found

   ```text
   ERROR: error executing step command 'provision': failed running post hooks: 'postprovision' hook failed with exit code: '1', Path: './infra/bicep/hooks/postprovision.sh'. : exit code: 1, stdout: 
   ...
   Message: Resource group 'xxx' could not be found.
   ```

   > This happens if you have default group in your az default config but the target group is not exist. Follow these steps to fix this
   > - Check the config with command `az config get defaults`, find the default group name 'xxx'
   > - Unset the default group config with command `az config unset defaults.group`
   > - Run `azd up` again

- Check your az login status:

   Run `az account show -o table` to see if you are already login to your target subscription.
   If not, run these commands:

   `az login --use-device-code`

   `az account set -s <subscription>`

 - Check the az extension

    Run command `az extension list -o table`, you should see both extension **containerapps** and **serviceconnector-passwordless** installed. If not, install with 

    `az extension add -n <name>`
