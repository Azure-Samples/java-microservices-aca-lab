# 2. Run Azd Command to deploy

Run `azd up` to deploy the petclinic solution and dependent components to Azure Container App

## Step by step guidance

1. Run `azd up`
    Fill the variables required from the prompt:

    ```text
    ? Enter a new environment name: <env-name>
    ? Select an Azure Subscription to use: xxx xxx
    ? Select an Azure location to use: xxx
    ```

    You may find the settings in directory `.azure/<env-name>/`

    Then azd commands are executed:
        - azd provision: create/update the azure resources defined in infra/bicep/main.bicep
        - azd package: package your solution via the services and docker configurations in ./azure.yaml
        - azd deploy: deploy the local build solution to azure services.

    If you meet any problems during this step, refer to page [Triage the issues](0603.md)

1. Run  `azd env get-values`
    You may see lots of variables from the results.
    Open the urls to your deployed service:

    ```text
    API gateway: gatewayFqdn="api-gateway.<cluster-id>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io"
    Admin Server: adminFqdn="admin-server.<cluster-id>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io"
    Spring Boot Admin: springbootAdminFqdn="springbootadmin-azure-java.ext.<cluster-id>.<region>.azurecontainerapps.io"
    ```

    Visit the urls to check the status of the services.
