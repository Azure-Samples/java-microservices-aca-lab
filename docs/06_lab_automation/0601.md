# 1. Prepare the environment

1. Install Azd version 1.11.0 or higher from [Install Azd](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)

1. Setup roles for your subscription

   Make sure you have both `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles to your target subscription.

   Goto your subscription page, select <kbd>Access control (IAM)</kbd>, then click <kbd>View my access</kbd> button to see your role assignments.

   - Role `Owner` already includes roles `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator`, no role assignment required if you already have the `Owner` role.
   - Contact your subscription administrator on new role assignments.

1. Login to Azd & Azure CLI
   - `azd auth login`
   - `az login`

   {: .note }
   > In case you are running this lab in a GitHub codespace, use `az login --use-device-code`.
   > Make sure login to your target subscription, or use `az account set -s <subscription-id>` to switch the subscription.

1. Collect your user info.

   - Get your user name

      ```bash
      export USER_NAME=$(az account show --query user.name --output tsv)
      echo $USER_NAME
      ```

   - Retrieve the user id.

      ```bash
      az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv
      ```

   - If you see errors like `AADSTS530003: Your device is required to be managed to access this resource.`, please collect the id in a managed device.

   - After you get your user object id, set the environment variables for later use.

      ```bash
      export AAD_USER_ID=<user-object-id>
      ```

      {: .note }
      > If you run the automation in PowerShell, export environment variables with commands like
      ```pwsh
      $env:AAD_USER_ID='<aad-user-id>
      ```
