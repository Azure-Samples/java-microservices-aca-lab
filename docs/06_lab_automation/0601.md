# 1. Prepare the environment

1. Roles for your subscription
   Make sure you have both `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles to your target subscription.
   Goto your subscription page, click `Access control (IAM)`, then click `View my access` button to see your role assignments.
   - Role `Owner` already includes roles `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator`
   - Contact your subscription administrator on new role assignments

1. Login to AZD & Azure CLI
   - `azd auth login`

   - `az login --use-device-code`

     Make sure login to your target subscription, or use `az account set -s <subscription-id>` to switch the subscription.

   - (Optional) Set your AAD user object id.

     This is required if you are using an environment that you can get your AAD user object id in that environment, like: github codespace, or windows VM. If you can get your AAD user object id via `az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv` in your environment to run `azd`, just skip this step.

     First, get your AAD user object id from another environment: `az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv`
     Second, set environment:
     - Linux environment: `export AAD_USER_ID='<aad-user-id>'`
     - Windows environment: `$env:AAD_USER_ID='<aad-user-id>'`
