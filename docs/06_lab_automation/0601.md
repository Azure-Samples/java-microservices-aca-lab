# 1. Prepare the environment

1. Roles for your subscription
   Make sure you have both `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles to your target subscription.
   Goto your subscription page, click `Access control (IAM)`, then click `View my access` button to see your role assignments.
   - Role `Owner` already includes roles `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator`
   - Contact your subscription administrator on new role assignments

1. Login to AZD & Azure CLI
   - `azd auth login`
   - `az login --use-device-code`

   Make sure login to your target subscription, or use `az account set -s <subscription-id>` to switch the subscription.
