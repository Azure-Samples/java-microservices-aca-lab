# Create an Azure MySQL Database service

You now have the compute service that will host your applications. Before you start deploying individual microservices as Azure Container Apps, you need to first create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server-hosted database for them. To accomplish this, you can use the following guidance:

- [Quickstart: Create an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server using Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mysql/flexible-server/quickstart-create-server-cli).

Your MySQL database will also have a firewall enabled. This firewall will by default block all incoming calls. You will need to open this firewall in case you want to connect to it from your microservices running in the ACA environment.

## Step by step guidance

1. Run the following commands to create an instance of MySQL Flexible server. Note that the name of the server must be globally unique, so adjust it accordingly in case the randomly generated name is already in use. Keep in mind that the name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens. In addition, replace the `<sqladmin-password>` placeholder with a complex password and record its value.

   > Here we use mysql admin password for apps to connect to sql server, this is not recommanded in production environment. Please refer to [Lab 04: Connect to Database securely using identity]({% link docs/04_lab_secrets/04_openlab_secrets_aca.md %}) for the secured managed identity solution.

   Replace the `<sqladmin-password>` with your own password.

   ```bash
   MYSQL_SERVER_NAME=mysql-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   MYSQL_ADMIN_USERNAME=sqladmin
   MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD="<sqladmin-password>"
   DATABASE_NAME=petclinic

   az mysql flexible-server create \
      --admin-user "$MYSQL_ADMIN_USERNAME" \
      --admin-password "$MYSQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
      --name "$MYSQL_SERVER_NAME" \
      --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" \
      --public-access none \
      --yes
   ```

   > Wait for the provisioning to complete. This might take about 3 minutes.

1. Run the following commands to create a database in the Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance.

   ```bash
   az mysql flexible-server db create \
      --server-name $MYSQL_SERVER_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      -d $DATABASE_NAME
   ```

1. You will also need to allow connections to the server from your ACA environment. For now, you will create a server firewall rule to allow inbound traffic from all Azure Services.

   Check the status of your sql server
   ![SQL Server Networking](../../images/sql-server-manage-firewall.png)

   The configuration `Allow Azure services and resources to access this server` adds an IP based firewall rule with start and end IP address of `0.0.0.0`, See [Connections from inside Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure?view=azuresql#connections-from-inside-azure).

   If this checkbox is not set for your sql server by default policy, run this command to set:

   ```bash
   az mysql flexible-server firewall-rule create \
      --rule-name allAzureIPs \
      --name $MYSQL_SERVER_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
   ```
