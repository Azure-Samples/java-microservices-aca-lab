# Create an Azure Container Apps environment

As a first step you will need to create your Azure Container Apps (ACA) environment. Make sure you also pre-create the virtual network for your ACA service. This will make it easier in the following labs to add additional networking features. You can use the following guidance:

- [Guidance on ACA environment and app creation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/tutorial-deploy-first-app-cli?tabs=bash)

## Step by step guidance

1. Run the following commands to create a resource group that will contain all of your resources (replace the `<azure-region>` placeholder with the name of any Azure region) in which you can create an Azure Container Apps Environment and an Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server instance, see [Region Availability]({% link tips.md %}#region-availability) for more info:

   ```bash
   UNIQUEID=$(openssl rand -hex 3)
   APPNAME=petclinic
   RESOURCE_GROUP=rg-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   LOCATION=<azure-region>
   az group create -g $RESOURCE_GROUP -l $LOCATION

   az configure --default group=$RESOURCE_GROUP
   ```

   {: .note }
   > Not all regions are ready for features for this lab, please refer to [Region Availability]({% link index.md %}#region-availability) for more details and select the proper `LOCATION`.

   {: .note }
   > This lab uses quite some environment variables. In case you are using a codespace for running this lab, your environment variables will be lost if the codespace restarts. You can find a couple of methods for persisting these environment variables across codespace restarts in the [LabTips]({% link tips.md %}).


1. Create a virtual network and subnet for your ACA.

   ```bash
   VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME=vnet-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   az network vnet create \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --name $VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --address-prefix 10.1.0.0/16
   
   ACA_SUBNET_CIDR=10.1.0.0/27
   az network vnet subnet create \
       --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --vnet-name $VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME \
       --address-prefixes $ACA_SUBNET_CIDR \
       --name aca-subnet \
       --delegations Microsoft.App/environments
   ```

1. You will need the ID of this subnet when you create the ACA environment.

   ```bash
   SUBNET_ID=$(az network vnet subnet show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --vnet-name $VIRTUAL_NETWORK_NAME --name aca-subnet --query id -o tsv)
   ```

1. Create your ACA environment and link it to the subnet you just created. We will be creating the environment in the dedicated plan. This plan is also called `workload profiles` plan. This plan gives you more advanced features as opposed to the consumption plan. In this plan you can choose whether you want to run your workload on dedicated hardware or consumption based. It basically gives you the choice. 

   ```bash
   ACA_ENVIRONMENT=acalab-env-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   az containerapp env create \
       -n $ACA_ENVIRONMENT \
       -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --enable-workload-profiles true \
       --infrastructure-subnet-resource-id $SUBNET_ID \
       --logs-destination none

   ACA_ENVIRONMENT_ID=$(az containerapp env show -n $ACA_ENVIRONMENT -g $RESOURCE_GROUP --query id -o tsv)
   ```

   {: .note }
   > If you are using Git Bash and get error message for the resource id, run `export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` then try again.
   > Wait for the provisioning to complete. This might take about 3 minutes.

1. View the resources

   In your browser navigate to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).

   Navigate to Resource Groups and select the resource group you just created.

   In the resource group overview you will see your newly created Azure container apps environment.

   {: .note }
   > In case you don't see the container apps environment in the overview list of the resource group, hit the <kbd>Refresh</kbd> button a couple of times, until they show up.

   {: .note }
   > You may also notice an additional resource group in your subscription, which name will start with ME_. This resource group got created by the ACA creation process. It holds the resources of the vnet and your ACA environment. For learning purposes it might be good to check this resource group from time to time and to see what got created there.
