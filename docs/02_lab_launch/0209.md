# Review

In this lab, you deployed the Spring Petclinic Microservices workload to Azure.

The following image should reflect your application architecture after a successful deployment.

> The work you did in this lab is fundamental to the next several labs youâ€™ll be working through, so please do not delete any of the Azure resources you've created here.
> 
>In addition to those resources, you also defined some environment variables as part of this lab, and many of these are also required in subsequent labs. To make sure you don't lose these variables after closing your current bash session, you'll want to save them. 
> 
> Before you move forward, in your open command-line window, go to the  `spring-petclinic-microservices` directory and run the command `source ../.devcontainer/saveenv.sh`. This will save the environment variables to the file `~/.dev-environment`, and any new bash sessions you start will automatically load the required variables. 
> 
> You can also manually load the saved variables with the command `source ~/.dev-environment`.
