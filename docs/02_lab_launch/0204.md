# Set up a configuration repository

You now have the compute service that will host your applications and the MySQL Server database to persistent the application data.

The Spring Petclinic microservices provides a config server that your apps can use. In Azure Container Apps, we can make use of the build-in config server component, which you will use in one of the next modules.

In this guide, we will see how we set the database info in configurations.

## Step by step guidance

You do need to however provide a git repository for this config server and link this git repo to the server. The current configuration used by the Spring microservices resides in the [config folder of the GitHub repo for this lab](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab/tree/main/config).

> We simplified some of the original config of the spring-petclinic-microservices application to make some of the lab steps easier to execute.

1. Check the content of the config file [application.yml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab/blob/main/config/application.yml).

   ```yaml
   spring:
     datasource:
       url: jdbc:mysql://${SQL_SERVER}.mysql.database.azure.com:3306/petclinic?useSSL=true
       username: ${SQL_USER}
       password: ${SQL_PASSWORD}
     sql:
       init:
         schema-locations: classpath*:db/mysql/schema.sql
         data-locations: classpath*:db/mysql/data.sql
         mode: ALWAYS
   ```

   - properties of `spring.datasource` to build connections to mysql database.
   - properties of `spring.sql.init` for sql database initial operations.

1. Collect info about the default git config repo

   ```bash
   GIT_URI="https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab.git"
   SEARCH_PATH="config"
   LABEL=main
   ```

{: .note }
> In the first part of this lab, we use public repository for the config server and put place holder variables in the application.yml config file for SQL user and passord. We have to put the credentials in some configurations when create or update container apps. In one of upcoming exercises, you will remediate this potential vulnerability by removing clear text credentials from your configuration.
