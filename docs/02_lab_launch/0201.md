# Collect user information

## Step by step guidance

1. On your lab environment, open a command line environment (WSL, Git Bash, PowerShell, or VSCode Terminal), run the following command to sign in to your Azure subscription:

   ```bash
   az login
   ```

   {: .note }
   > In case you are running this lab in a GitHub codespace, use `az login --use-device-code`.

   Executing the command will automatically open a web browser window prompting you to authenticate. Once prompted, sign in using the user account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription that you will use in this lab and close the web browser window.

1. Make sure that you are logged in to the right subscription for the consecutive commands.

   ```bash
   az account list -o table
   ```

   If in the above statement you don't see the right account being indicated as your default one, change your environment to the right subscription with the following command, replacing the `<subscription-id>`.

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

1. Collect your user info.

   - Get your user name.

     ```bash
     export USER_NAME=$(az account show --query user.name --output tsv)
     echo $USER_NAME
     ```

   - Retrieve the user object id.

     ```bash
     az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv
     ```

     {: .note }
     If you see errors like `AADSTS530003: Your device is required to be managed to access this resource`, please collect the id manually with one of the ways:

     - In the Azure Portal, open [Microsoft Entra ID](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview), input the user name you just collected to the search box of `Overview`, select the `Users` in the search result, and locate the `Object ID` of the user.
     - In a managed device, open a command line environment, run command `az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv`.

     Once you get your user object id, set the environment variables for later use:

     ```bash
     export AAD_USER_ID=<user-object-id>
     ```
