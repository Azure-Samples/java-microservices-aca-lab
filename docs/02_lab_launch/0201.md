# Collect user information

First, you’ll need to sign your lab environment in to Azure and configure it to access the lab subscription. Then you’ll store your user info for use in subsequent steps.

## Step-by-step guidance

1.  In your lab environment, open a command-line environment (Windows Subsystem for Linux, Git Bash, PowerShell, or VS Code terminal) and sign in to your Azure subscription with the following command:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

    {: .note }
    > If you’re running this lab in GitHub Codespaces, use az login --use-device-code.

    When you execute the command, it automatically opens a web browser window and requires that you authenticate. When prompted, sign in with the user account (with the Owner role) in the Azure subscription that you have for this lab and then close the browser window.

1.  Make sure that you’re signed in to the lab subscription:

    ```bash
    az account list -o table
    ```

    If you don't see the correct lab account listed as your default one, use the following command to adjust your Azure CLI session to use the correct subscription (replace \<*subscription-id*\> with the lab subscription’s ID):

    ```bash
    az account set --subscription \<subscription-id\>
    ```

1.  Collect your user info, and then store it for future use.
    - Store your username in an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export USER_NAME=$(az account show --query user.name --output tsv)
    echo $USER_NAME
    ```

    - Retrieve the user object ID:

    ```bash
    az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv
    ```

    {: .note } 
    > If you receive an error, such as “AADSTS530003: Your device is required to be managed to access this resource,” use one of the following options to manually collect the user object ID:

        - If you’re using a device managed by your organization, open a command-line environment and run the command az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv.
        
        - Otherwise, in the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), open [Microsoft Entra ID](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview). In the `Search` box of the Overview page, enter the username that you just collected. In the search results, select the user and then locate the user Object ID.

    - After you get your user object ID, store it as an environment variable for later use:

     ```bash
     export AAD_USER_ID=<user-object-id>
     ```
