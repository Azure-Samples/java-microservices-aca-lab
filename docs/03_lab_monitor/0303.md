# Configure Application Insights to receive monitoring information from your applications

You now know how to set up monitoring for your overall Azure Container Apps environment. However, you would also like to get monitoring info on how your applications run in the cluster. To track Application specific monitoring data, you can use Application Insights.

In this next module you will create an Application Insights resource and enable application monitoring for each of your microservices. For enabling this, you will not have to change anything in your microservices themselves, you can make use of the Java auto-instrumentation feature of Azure Monitor, which uses an agent-based approach to collect the monitoring data. 

Currently, to add the Application Insights monitoring agent to your apps, you need to include the Application Insights jar file to your microservices. The only way to do that is to take hold of the containerization process. You will use a Dockerfile to redeploy the container apps for this lab to add application insights. The following steps are needed: 

- Create a dockerfile for containerizing your microservices.
- Add the Application Insights jar file to your docker file.
- Add an environment variable to your microservices with the connection string info for your Application Insights instance. 
- To get a proper application map in Application Insights, you will also have to define a different role for each of the microservices in the cluster, so Application Insights knows what microservice the monitoring data comes from. 

You can follow the below guidance to do so.

- [Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry-based auto-instrumentation for Java applications](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-in-process-agent)
- [Spring Boot via Docker entry point](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-spring-boot#spring-boot-via-docker-entry-point)
- [Workspace-based Application Insights resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource#create-a-resource-automatically)

## Step by step guidance

1. As a first step, you will need to create an Application Insights resource. Execute the below statement in your bash shell.

   ```bash
   WORKSPACEID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show -n $WORKSPACE -g $RESOURCE_GROUP --query id -o tsv)
   AINAME=app-insights-$APPNAME-$UNIQUEID
   az extension add -n application-insights --upgrade
   az monitor app-insights component create \
       --app $AINAME \
       --location $LOCATION \
       --kind web \
       -g $RESOURCE_GROUP \
       --workspace $WORKSPACEID
   ```

1. Make note of the Application Insights connection string, you will need this later in this module.

   ```bash
   AI_CONNECTIONSTRING=$(az monitor app-insights component show --app $AINAME -g $RESOURCE_GROUP --query connectionString --output tsv)
   echo $AI_CONNECTIONSTRING
   ```

1. Build a image with application insights agent, and set the related environment variables.

   We customize the Dockerfile to build the image with application insights agent. The content of the Dockerfile is

   ```dockerfile
   # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

   # build
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/openjdk/jdk:17-mariner AS build
   ARG AI_VERSION=3.5.4
   RUN yum update -y && \
      yum install -y wget

   RUN wget https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Java/releases/download/$AI_VERSION/applicationinsights-agent-$AI_VERSION.jar -O ai.jar --quiet

   # run
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/openjdk/jdk:17-distroless

   COPY --from=build ./ai.jar ai.jar
   COPY ./target/*.jar app.jar
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Run with javaagent
   ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom", "-javaagent:/ai.jar", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
   ```

   This content is saved in file **../tools/ai.Dockerfile**, we use the saved content directly in the next steps.

1. You will now use Azure Container Registry with customized Dockerfile to build your image, and update the container app to enable Application Insights Agent.

   Do this first for the **api-gateway** service. Notice how you are also setting the environment variables `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_CONTENT`.

   ```bash
   APP_NAME="api-gateway"
   cp ../tools/ai.Dockerfile spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME/Dockerfile

   az containerapp update \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --source ./spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME \
      --set-env-vars APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=$AI_CONNECTIONSTRING APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_CONTENT='{"role": {"name": "'$APP_NAME'"}}'
   ```

1. Once the app **api-gateway** deployment has succeeded, execute the same statements for the other microservices **customers-service**, **vets-service** and **visits-service**.

   To save the execute time, you may use the script **../tools/build-update-apps.sh** to deploy the apps:

   ```bash
   export RESOURCE_GROUP MYACR IMAGE_TAG AI_CONNECTIONSTRING
   ../tools/build-update-apps.sh
   ```

   Or you can run the commands one by one to build and update these apps:

   ```bash
   APP_NAME="customers-service"
   cp ../tools/ai.Dockerfile spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME/Dockerfile
   az containerapp update \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --source ./spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME \
      --set-env-vars APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=$AI_CONNECTIONSTRING APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_CONTENT='{"role": {"name": "'$APP_NAME'"}}'

   APP_NAME="vets-service"
   cp ../tools/ai.Dockerfile spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME/Dockerfile
   az containerapp update \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --source ./spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME \
      --set-env-vars APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=$AI_CONNECTIONSTRING APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_CONTENT='{"role": {"name": "'$APP_NAME'"}}'

   APP_NAME="visits-service"
   cp ../tools/ai.Dockerfile spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME/Dockerfile
   az containerapp update \
      --name $APP_NAME \
      --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
      --source ./spring-petclinic-$APP_NAME \
      --set-env-vars APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING=$AI_CONNECTIONSTRING APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONFIGURATION_CONTENT='{"role": {"name": "'$APP_NAME'"}}'
   ```

   > Notice that for each of the microservices, we indicate a different _role-name_. This role-name will be used in the Application Insights Application Map to properly show the communication between your microservices.

   {: .note }
   > To make sure everything is back up and running as expected, you may want to double check if all your services are back up and running. Check console log if you are seeing any service in failed state.

## Analyze application specific monitoring data

Now that Application Insights is properly configured, you can use this service to monitor what is going on in your application. You can follow the below guidance to do so.

- [Application Insights Overview dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/overview-dashboard)

Use this guidance to take a look at:
- The Application Map
- Performance data
- Failures
- Metrics
- Live Metrics
- Availability
- Logs

To get the logging information flowing, you should navigate to your application and to the different sub-pages and refresh each page a couple of times. It might take some time to update Application Insights with information from your application.

Step by step operations

1. In your browser, navigate to the Azure Portal and your resource group.

1. Select the Application Insights resource in the resource group. On the overview page you will already see data about Failed requests, Server response time, Server requests and Availability.

   ![ai_overview](../../images/ai_overview.png)

1. Select _Application map_. This will show you information about the different applications running in your Spring Cloud Service and their dependencies. This is where the role names you configured in the YAML files are used.

   ![application map](../../images/app-map.png)

1. Select the _api-gateway_ service. This will show you details about this application, like slowest requests and failed dependencies.

   ![api-gateway](../../images/api-gateway.png)

1. Select _Performance_. This will show you more data on performance. 

   ![performance](../../images/api-gw-perf.png)

1. You can also drag your mouse on the graph to select a specific time period, and it will update the view.

1. Select again your Application Insights resource to navigate back to the _Application map_ and the highlighted _api-gateway_ service.

1. Select _Live Metrics_, to see live metrics of your application. This will show you near real time performance of your application, as well as the logs and traces coming in

   ![live metrics](../../images/live-perf.png)

1. Select _Availability_, and next _Create Standard test_, to configure an availability test for your application.

1. Fill out the following details and select _Create_: 

   - *Test name*: Name for your test
   - *URL*: Fill out the URL to your api-gateway
   - Keep all the default settings for the rest of the configuration. Notice that Alerts for this test will be enabled.

   Once created every 5 minutes your application will now be pinged for availability from 5 test locations.

1. Select the three dots on the right of your newly created availability test and select _Open Rules (Alerts) page_.

1. Select the alert rule for your availability test. By default there are no action groups associated with this alert rule. We will not configure them in this lab, but just for your information, with action groups you can send email or SMS notifications to specific people or groups.
    
   - [Create and manage action groups in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/action-groups) 

1. Navigate back to your Application Insights resource.

1. Select _Failures_, to see information on all failures in your applications. You can click on any of the response codes, exception types or failed dependencies to get more information on these failures.

   ![failures](../../images/failure.png)

1. Select _Performance_, to see performance data of your applications' operations. This will be a similar view to the one you looked at earlier.

   ![performance](../../images/perf2.png)

1.  Select _Logs_, to see all logged data. You can use Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to search and analyze the logged data
    
   * [Log queries in Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-query-overview) 

   {:style="counter-reset:step-counter 16"}
1.  Select _Queries_ and next _Performance_.

1.  Double click _Operations performance_. This will load this query in the query window.

1.  Select _Run_, to see the results of this query.
