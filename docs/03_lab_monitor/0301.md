# Inspect your Azure Container Apps in the Azure Portal

By default the Azure Portal already gives you quite some info on the current status of the ACA instance. In this first part of this module, open the Azure Portal, navigate to one of your ACA instances and inspect what info you can find on the instance. Try and find information on:

- The ACA replica status.
- The live logs (console and system) of the `customers-service`.

You can follow the below guidance to do so.

- [log streams in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/log-streaming?tabs=bash)


## Step by step guidance

1. In your browser navigate to the Azure Portal, and to the resource group where you deployed your Azure Container Apps environment. Select the customers-service container app.

1. In the menu under `Application`, select `Revisions and replicas`. Check the status of revisions.
