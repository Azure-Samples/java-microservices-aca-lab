# Review

In this lab, you configured autoscaling rules for your applications to ensure they remain responsive and cost-efficient. Specifically, you: 

- Set up an HTTP scaling rule for an HTTP-based application.
- Configured an Azure Service Bus scaling rule for an event-driven application.


The below image illustrates the end state you have achieved in this lab.
