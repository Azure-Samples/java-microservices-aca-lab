# Lab 11: Set up autoscaling for microservices on ACA

# Student manual

## Lab scenario

Azure Container Apps manages automatic horizontal scaling through a set of declarative scaling rules. These rules allow your application to scale up or down based on specific triggers, such as incoming HTTP requests, TCP connections, or any [ScaledJob](https://keda.sh/docs/2.15/concepts/scaling-jobs/)-based [KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/2.15/scalers/). 

In this lab, you will learn how to set up autoscaling rules for your applications. This will ensure that your applications are responsive, cost-effective, and capable of handling varying traffic loads efficiently. You can find more information on
- [Set scaling rules in Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/scale-app)

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Update an existing microservice to use an HTTP scaling rule
- Update an existing microservice to set up a custom scaling rule
- Try out the existing microservices

The below image illustrates the end state you will be building in this lab.
