# 1. Run Azd Command to deploy

Run `azd up` to deploy the petclinic solution and dependent components to Azure Container App

## Step by step guidance

1. Run `azd up`

    - fill your environment name.
    - select the target subscription
    - select the target region

    This command will create these components to your environment:

    - Resource Group
    - Virtual Network with subnets
    - Log Analytics Workspace
    - Azure Container Apps environment
    - Managed components in ACA environment: SpringCloudEureka / SpringCloudConfig / SpringBootAdmin
    - MySQL flexibleServers
    - The petclinic solution apps api-gateway, admin-server, customer-service, vets-service, visits-service

    You can view detailed progress in the Azure Portal: xxx
    Open the link to check the deployment status in portal

    {: .note }
    > You may encounter some failures during the deploy, fix the errors according to the deployment status.
    > If there are internal errors, please re-run the `azd up` commands to redeploy.

1. Run rebuild service connection from apps to sql database
    Due to some limitation, the bicep won't create database user for the service connections, See Lab 4 step 2.

    Run the commands below to create the db user

    ```bash
    CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $ACA_IDENTITY --query 'clientId' --output tsv)
    echo $CLIENT_ID
    az containerapp connection create mysql-flexible \
    --connection mysql_conn \
    --source-id $CUSTOMERS_ID \
    --target-id $DB_ID \
    --client-type SpringBoot \
    --user-identity client-id=$CLIENT_ID subs-id=$SUBID mysql-identity-id=$ADMIN_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID \
    -c customers-service
    ```

    Only one command required for this solution:

    - The apps share the same connection name, so same user name in db.
    - Once the user name is set, your don't have to recreate it.

1. Verify

    - visit the api-gateway Application Url
    - visit the admin-server Application Url
