# Review

In this lab, you secured your database connection secrets for your Spring Petclinic Microservices workload, without needing to make application code changes, by using Azure Service Connector and managed identities.

As part of this process, you:

-   Created a database administrator account.
-   Updated the application dependencies to enable passwordless connectivity.
-   Created service connections from your applications to the database server.

The following diagram should reflect your applicationâ€™s current architecture.
