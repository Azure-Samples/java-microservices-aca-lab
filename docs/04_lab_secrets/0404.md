# Review

In this lab, you secured your database connection secrets for your Spring Petclinic Microservices application by using Azure Service Connector.

As part of this process, you:

-   Updated the application dependencies to enable passwordless connectivity.
-   Created service connections from your microservices to the database server.

The following diagram should reflect your applicationâ€™s current architecture.
