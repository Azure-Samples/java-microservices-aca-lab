# Update the applications to use passwordless connectivity

To use the azure service connection, some java dependencies are required to the apps, and you will rebuild the apps apply the new dependencies.

The following three apps of your application use the database hosted by the Azure Database for MySQL Single Server instance, so they will need to have their code updated:

- `customers-service`
- `vets-service`
- `visits-service`

## Step by step guidance

1. In the main `pom.xml` file add an additional property between the `<properties></properties>` element for the Azure Spring Cloud version we are going to use.

   ```xml
   <version.spring.cloud.azure>5.18.0</version.spring.cloud.azure>
   ```

1. In the same file add the Azure BOM as an extra dependency between the `<dependencyManagement><dependencies></dependencies></dependencyManagement>` elements.

   ```xml
               <dependency>
                  <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
                  <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
                  <version>${version.spring.cloud.azure}</version>
                  <type>pom</type>
                  <scope>import</scope>
               </dependency>
   ```

1. You will now need to update the `spring-petclinic-customers-service`, `spring-petclinic-visits-service` and `spring-petclinic-vets-service` to make use of the passwordless capabilities of the Azure SDK. In each `pom.xml` file of each microservice replace the `mysql-connector-j` artifact by this one:

   ```xml
           <dependency>
               <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
               <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-jdbc-mysql</artifactId>
           </dependency>
   ```

1. Build projects.

   ```bash
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```
