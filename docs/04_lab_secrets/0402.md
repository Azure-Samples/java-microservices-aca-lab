# Update the applications to use passwordless connectivity

Now, with the database configured, you’ll update your services to use the passwordless connection. This method relies on Azure Service Connector, which requires additional Java dependencies. To include these new dependencies, you’ll update some of your app code and then rebuild your apps.

Three of your application’s component microservices connect to the database, so you’ll need to update their code and rebuild them:

- `customers-service`
- `vets-service`
- `visits-service`

## Step-by-step guidance

1.  Update the main POM file. 

    In the main `pom.xml` file, add another property between the `<properties></properties>` element for the Azure Spring Cloud version that we’re going to use:

    ```xml
    <version.spring.cloud.azure>5.18.0</version.spring.cloud.azure>
    ```

    In the same file, add the Azure Spring BOM (Bill of Materials) as an extra dependency between the `<dependencyManagement><dependencies></dependencies></dependencyManagement>` elements:

    ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${version.spring.cloud.azure}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    ```

1.  Now you’ll need to update the POM files for the `spring-petclinic-customers-service`, `spring-petclinic-visits-service` and `spring-petclinic-vets-service` projects to make use of the managed identity capabilities of the Azure SDK.

    In the `pom.xml` file for each of these microservices, replace the `mysql-connector-j` artifact with this one:

    ```xml
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.azure.spring</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-azure-starter-jdbc-mysql</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    ```

1.  Next, you’ll want to modify the associated SQL schemas to ensure you’ve removed any unnecessary user access. You can do this by opening them and removing the line `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON petclinic.* TO pc@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'pc';`.

    To update the schema files at once, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sed -i '/GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON/d' spring-petclinic-customers-service/src/main/resources/db/mysql/schema.sql
    sed -i '/GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON/d' spring-petclinic-vets-service/src/main/resources/db/mysql/schema.sql
    sed -i '/GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON/d' spring-petclinic-visits-service/src/main/resources/db/mysql/schema.sql
    ```

1.  Rebuild the projects:

    ```bash
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```
