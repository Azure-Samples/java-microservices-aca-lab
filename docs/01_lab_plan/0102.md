# Azure Service resources for hosting your application

## Azure Container Apps

In this lab, we use [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview) to run the petclinic microservices applicaiton. Azure Container Apps support native spring boot applications.

1. Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform that allows you to maintain less infrastructure and save costs while running containerized applications. Instead of worrying about server configuration, container orchestration, and deployment details, Container Apps provides all the up-to-date server resources required to keep your applications stable and secure.

1. Azure Container Apps support spring boot managed components like [Eureka Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/java-eureka-server?tabs=azure-cli), [Config Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/java-config-server?tabs=azure-cli) and [Spring Boot Admin](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/java-admin?tabs=azure-cli).

1. [Gateway for Spring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/java-gateway-for-spring) is supported in Azure Container Apps.

1. Some features are supported in Azure Container Apps to build more secure application. 
   - [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/managed-identity?tabs=portal%2Cdotnet)
   - [Service Connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-connector/quickstart-portal-container-apps?tabs=SMI)

In this lab, we use the api-gateway application with external ingress to serve the user requests. And the backend services are running in container apps with internal ingress settings.

The Azure Container Apps environment can host the entire microservice applications with litte management work.

Here are the components in Azure Container Apps to host the application. Developers just take care of the service applications and Azure Container Apps takes care of the managed components.

## Other components to better manage your applicaiton

1. [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro)

   Azure Container Registry is a managed registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. Create and maintain Azure container registries to store and manage your container images and related artifacts.

1. [Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview)

   Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed, production-ready relational database service in the Microsoft Cloud. It's based on the [MySQL Community Edition](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/) (available under the GPLv2 license) database engine. The service gives you granular control and flexibility over database management functions and configuration settings.

1. Azure Monitor

   Azure offers lots of toos for better monitoring and tracing the status of your application, here we introduce some of them on the petclinic application

   - [Log Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)

      Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that's used to edit and run log queries against data in the Azure Monitor Logs store.
