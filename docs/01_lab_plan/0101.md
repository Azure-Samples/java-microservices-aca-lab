# Examine the application components based on the GitHub repository information

Your first step is to familiarize yourself with the existing [Spring Petclinic Microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) application, its components, and the GitHub repository where its source code is located.

## Step-by-step guidance

To start, you’ll learn about the Spring Petclinic Microservices app.

1.  On your lab computer, open a web browser, go to [GitHub](https://github.com), and sign in to your GitHub account. If you don’t have a GitHub account, create one (go to [Join GitHub](https://github.com/join), and follow the instructions at [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account)).
1.  Go to the [source folder of this lab’s GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab/tree/main/src), and review the **README.md file**. 
1.  Learn how to run the application in dev environments. Pay particular attention to the readme sections that cover [starting services locally without Docker](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab/tree/main/src#starting-services-locally-without-docker), [starting services locally with docker-compose](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab/tree/main/src#starting-services-locally-with-docker-compose), and [starting services locally with docker-compose and Java](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/java-microservices-aca-lab/tree/main/src#starting-services-locally-with-docker-compose-and-java). After you’ve configured your development environment, if time permits, consider launching the application locally using one of these methods.
1.  In the source folder of this lab’s GitHub repo, go to each folder that contains the code of the individual spring-petclinic-\* services and review the content.

Important components to review include:

-   Spring Boot services, such as the customers, vets, and visits services.
-   The API gateway service used to route external requests to the verious internal services.
-   Spring Boot components, such as a Eureka service (providing discovery capabilities across microservices), a Spring Cloud Config Server, and a Spring Boot Admin Server.
-   The external GitHub repo and database.

Explore the repository until you’re familiar with how the app works. You don’t need to understand all the details, but you should know the basic app structure and should have a high-level overview of the various components and what they do.

After you’ve reviewed the GitHub repository, you can move to the next steps in planning your deployment.
