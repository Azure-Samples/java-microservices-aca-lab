To start, you will learn about the existing Spring Petclinic application.

1. The components of the microservice application

   ![microservices overview](../../images/services.png)

   - Spring boot services including vets service, customer service, visits service and AI chat agent.
   - A gateway service role as the spring gateway to route the requests.
   - Spring boot components including Eureka Server, Congfig Server and the Spring Boot Admin.
   - External github repo and database.

1. In the web browser displaying the GitHub repo, navigate to each folder containing the code of the individual spring-petclinic-* services and review their content. You don't need to know their full details, but you should understand their basic structure.

1. Make sure you create a local copy of this project for you to work in during the lab. You may also want to push this local copy to a git repository you own.

## Step by step guidance

1. On your lab computer, start a web browser and navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account, create one by navigating to [the Join GitHub page](https://github.com/join) and following the instructions provided on [the Signing up for a new GitHub account page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).

1. For the next install and setup steps use the guidance in the [Installation]({% link install.md %}) instructions.
