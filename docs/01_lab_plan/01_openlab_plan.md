# Lab 01: Plan your application deployment

## Introduction

Before you can deploy the example Spring Petclinic Microservices app to Azure, you need to determine what application components need to move to Azure , which Azure resources you’ll use to host these components, and what tools you’ll need to perform the deployment.

In this first lab session, you’ll explore the sample application code and configure your development environment. You’ll also evaluate the application’s technical and operational requirements to determine the best hosting, storage, and organizational approach for moving the Spring Petclinic Microservices app to Azure.

## What you’ll cover

As you work through this lab, you’ll:

-   Examine the information provided in the sample application’s GitHub repository and dive into the app’s various components.
-   Review the Azure services that you’ll use to host the application.
-   Make sure that your lab development environment is set up to connect and manage your Azure resources.
