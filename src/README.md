This microservices branch was initially derived from [AngularJS version](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular1) to demonstrate how to split sample Spring application into [microservices](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).
To achieve that goal, we use Spring Cloud Gateway, Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker, Spring Cloud Config, Micrometer Tracing, Resilience4j, Open Telemetry 
and the Eureka Service Discovery from the [Spring Cloud Netflix](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix) technology stack.

## Starting services locally without Docker

Every microservice is a Spring Boot application and can be started locally using IDE ([Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) plugin has to be set up) or `../mvnw spring-boot:run` command. Please note that supporting services (Config and Discovery Server) must be started before any other application (Customers, Vets, Visits and API).
Startup of Tracing server, Admin server, Grafana and Prometheus is optional.
If everything goes well, you can access the following services at given location:
* Discovery Server - http://localhost:8761
* Config Server - http://localhost:8888
* AngularJS frontend (API Gateway) - http://localhost:8080
* Customers, Vets and Visits Services - random port, check Eureka Dashboard 
* Tracing Server (Zipkin) - http://localhost:9411/zipkin/ (we use [openzipkin](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/main/zipkin-server))
* Admin Server (Spring Boot Admin) - http://localhost:9090
* Grafana Dashboards - http://localhost:3000
* Prometheus - http://localhost:9091

You can tell Config Server to use your local Git repository by using `native` Spring profile and setting
`GIT_REPO` environment variable, for example:
`-Dspring.profiles.active=native -DGIT_REPO=/projects/spring-petclinic-microservices-config`

## Starting services locally with docker-compose
In order to start entire infrastructure using Docker, you have to build images by executing
``bash
./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker
``
This requires `Docker` or `Docker desktop` to be installed and running.

Alternatively you can also build all the images on `Podman`, which requires Podman or Podman Desktop to be installed and running.
```bash
./mvnw clean install -PbuildDocker -Dcontainer.executable=podman
```
By default, the Docker OCI image is build for an `linux/amd64` platform.
For other architectures, you could change it by using the `-Dcontainer.platform` maven command line argument.
For instance, if you target container images for an Apple M2, you could use the command line with the `linux/arm64` architecture:
```bash
./mvnw clean install -P buildDocker -Dcontainer.platform="linux/arm64"
```

Once images are ready, you can start them with a single command
`docker-compose up` or `podman-compose up`. 

Containers startup order is coordinated with the `service_healthy` condition of the Docker Compose [depends-on](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/spec.md#depends_on) expression 
and the [healthcheck](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/main/spec.md#healthcheck) of the service containers. 
After starting services, it takes a while for API Gateway to be in sync with service registry,
so don't be scared of initial Spring Cloud Gateway timeouts. You can track services availability using Eureka dashboard
available by default at http://localhost:8761.

The `main` branch uses an Eclipse Temurin with Java 17 as Docker base image.

*NOTE: Under MacOSX or Windows, make sure that the Docker VM has enough memory to run the microservices. The default settings
are usually not enough and make the `docker-compose up` painfully slow.*


## Starting services locally with docker-compose and Java
If you experience issues with running the system via docker-compose you can try running the `./scripts/run_all.sh` script that will start the infrastructure services via docker-compose and all the Java based applications via standard `nohup java -jar ...` command. The logs will be available under `${ROOT}/target/nameoftheapp.log`. 

Each of the java based applications is started with the `chaos-monkey` profile in order to interact with Spring Boot Chaos Monkey. You can check out the (README)[scripts/chaos/README.md] for more information about how to use the `./scripts/chaos/call_chaos.sh` helper script to enable assaults.

## In case you find a bug/suggested improvement for Spring Petclinic Microservices

Our issue tracker is available here: https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/issues

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setup is provided for MySql in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
Dependency for Connector/J, the MySQL JDBC driver is already included in the `pom.xml` files.

### Start a MySql database

You may start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```
or download and install the MySQL database (e.g., MySQL Community Server 5.7 GA), which can be found here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

### Use the Spring 'mysql' profile

To use a MySQL database, you have to start 3 microservices (`visits-service`, `customers-service` and `vets-services`)
with the `mysql` Spring profile. Add the `--spring.profiles.active=mysql` as programm argument.

By default, at startup, database schema will be created and data will be populated.
You may also manually create the PetClinic database and data by executing the `"db/mysql/{schema,data}.sql"` scripts of each 3 microservices. 
In the `application.yml` of the [Configuration repository], set the `initialization-mode` to `never`.

If you are running the microservices with Docker, you have to add the `mysql` profile into the (Dockerfile)[docker/Dockerfile]:
```
ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE docker,mysql
```
In the `mysql section` of the `application.yml` from the [Configuration repository], you have to change 
the host and port of your MySQL JDBC connection string. 

## Custom metrics monitoring

Grafana and Prometheus are included in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, and the public facing applications
have been instrumented with [MicroMeter](https://micrometer.io) to collect JVM and custom business metrics.

A JMeter load testing script is available to stress the application and generate metrics: [petclinic_test_plan.jmx](spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/test/jmeter/petclinic_test_plan.jmx)

![Grafana metrics dashboard](docs/grafana-custom-metrics-dashboard.png)

### Using Prometheus

* Prometheus can be accessed from your local machine at http://localhost:9091

### Using Grafana with Prometheus

* An anonymous access and a Prometheus datasource are setup.
* A `Spring Petclinic Metrics` Dashboard is available at the URL http://localhost:3000/d/69JXeR0iw/spring-petclinic-metrics.
You will find the JSON configuration file here: [docker/grafana/dashboards/grafana-petclinic-dashboard.json]().
* You may create your own dashboard or import the [Micrometer/SpringBoot dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) via the Import Dashboard menu item.
The id for this dashboard is `4701`.

### Custom metrics
Spring Boot registers a lot number of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback... 
The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC.
All those three REST controllers `OwnerResource`, `PetResource` and `VisitResource` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at class level.

* `customers-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.owner`
  * @Timed: `petclinic.pet`
* `visits-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.visit`

## Pushing to a Docker registry

Docker images for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms have been published into DockerHub 
in the [springcommunity](https://hub.docker.com/u/springcommunity) organization.
You can pull an image:
```bash
docker pull springcommunity/spring-petclinic-config-server
```
You may prefer to build then push images to your own Docker registry.

### Choose your Docker registry

You need to define your target Docker registry.
Make sure you're already logged in by running `docker login <endpoint>` or `docker login` if you're just targeting Docker hub.

Setup the `REPOSITORY_PREFIX` env variable to target your Docker registry.
If you're targeting Docker hub, simple provide your username, for example:
```bash
export REPOSITORY_PREFIX=springcommunity
```

For other Docker registries, provide the full URL to your repository, for example:
```bash
export REPOSITORY_PREFIX=harbor.myregistry.com/petclinic
```

To push Docker image for the `linux/amd64` and the `linux/arm64` platform to your own registry, please use the command line:
```bash
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip -P buildDocker -Ddocker.image.prefix=${REPOSITORY_PREFIX} -Dcontainer.build.extraarg="--push" -Dcontainer.platform="linux/amd64,linux/arm64"
```

The `scripts/pushImages.sh` and `scripts/tagImages.sh` shell scripts could also be used once you build your image with the `buildDocker` maven profile.
The `scripts/tagImages.sh` requires to declare the `VERSION` env variable.

## Compiling the CSS

There is a `petclinic.css` in `spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/main/resources/static/css`.
It was generated from the `petclinic.scss` source, combined with the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library.
If you make changes to the `scss`, or upgrade Bootstrap, you will need to re-compile the CSS resources
using the Maven profile `css` of the `spring-petclinic-api-gateway`module.
```bash
cd spring-petclinic-api-gateway
mvn generate-resources -P css
```

## Interesting Spring Petclinic forks

The Spring Petclinic `main` branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

This [spring-petclinic-microservices](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices/) project is one of the [several forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) 
hosted in a special GitHub org: [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic).
If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
